                <p>I am a driven and hardworking single mom of two kids who balances a full-time job as a Systems and
                    Network Engineer at Educational Service Unit 2 with my studies as a full-time student pursuing a
                    Bachelor's degree in Web Development. In my free time, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies of
                    woodworking
                    and tackling DIY projects, as well as cherishing every moment with my kids.</p>

                <p>the summers you can find us out on the lake soaking up life. My passion for technology
                    and my drive to continuously learn and improve have led me on a journey to reach new heights in both
                    my
                    personal and professional life. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and look forward to
                    the
                    challenges and opportunities that await me.</p>
