                    <p>I am a driven and hardworking single mom of two kids who balances a full-time job as a Systems
                        and
                        Network Engineer at Educational Service Unit 2 with my studies as a full-time student pursuing a
                        Bachelor's degree in Web Development. In my free time, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies of
                        woodworking
                        and tackling DIY projects, as well as cherishing every moment with my kids. My passion for technology and my drive to continuously learn and improve have led me on a
                        journey to reach new heights in
                        both my personal and professional life. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and look
                        forward to the
                        challenges and opportunities that await me.</p>

                    <p>My kids are my world. They are the reason I get up every morning and the reason I push myself to
                        be the best
                        version of myself. They are my motivation to succeed and my inspiration to keep going. They are
                        the reason I
                        am who I am today and the reason I will continue to grow and learn. I am so grateful for them and
                        I am so
                        excited to see what the future holds for them.</p>
