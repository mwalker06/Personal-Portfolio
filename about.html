                    <h3>Hello...</h3>
                    <p>I am honored to introduce myself as a passionate, goal-oriented, and hardworking individual who
                        takes pride in juggling multiple roles with finesse. As a US Army Veteran and a devoted single
                        mom of two adorable kids, I have learned to embrace challenges and push beyond my limits to
                        achieve success.</p>

                    <p>I currently hold a full-time position as a Systems and Network Engineer at Educational Service
                        Unit 2, where I bring my expertise and technical skills to the forefront of my work. Alongside
                        my demanding job, I am also pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Web Development, with a focus on
                        expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in this ever-evolving field. Being a full-time
                        student while holding a full-time job can be quite daunting, but I believe in the power of
                        determination and grit to overcome any obstacle.</p>

                    <p>When I am not immersing myself in the world of technology, I enjoy channeling my creativity and
                        passion through woodworking and DIY projects. These activities not only serve as a refreshing
                        break from my routine but also help me enhance my problem-solving and critical thinking
                        abilities.</p>

                    <p>Above all, my most cherished moments are spent with my children, who are my biggest motivation
                        and source of inspiration. Their unconditional love and unwavering support have been the driving
                        force behind my pursuit of excellence, both personally and professionally.</p>

                    <p> My unwavering passion for technology and my relentless drive to continually learn and improve
                        have set me on a path to reach new heights in my career and personal life. I am thrilled to see
                        where this journey takes me and look forward to embracing the challenges and opportunities that
                        come my way.</p>

                <div class="left-text">
                    <p>Without a doubt, my children are the most important people in my life. They are my world, my
                        reason for being, and my driving force to become the best version of myself. Every morning, when
                        I wake up to their smiling faces, I am reminded of the immense responsibility and privilege that
                        comes with being a parent.</p>

                    <p>My two kids are the source of my motivation and inspiration, always pushing me to excel in every
                        aspect of my life. Their unwavering support and unconditional love give me the strength and
                        courage to tackle any challenge that comes my way. I feel immensely grateful to have them in my
                        life, as they have taught me the true meaning of unconditional love, selflessness, and
                        sacrifice.</p>

                    <p> As a parent, I am constantly learning and growing, and my children have been my greatest
                        teachers in this regard. They have taught me to be patient, compassionate, and empathetic. They
                        have also shown me the importance of being present and fully engaged in every moment, as time
                        flies by too quickly, and every moment counts.</p>

                    <p>As they grow older and embark on their own journeys, I am excited to see what the future holds
                        for them. I am confident that they will continue to make me proud with their achievements and
                        accomplishments. As a parent, my greatest hope is that they will always stay true to themselves,
                        pursue their passions, and find happiness and fulfillment in whatever they choose to do.</p>
