                        JavaScript in the Enterprise. Focus is on the JavaScript programming language syntax, software
                        design, coding, documenting, and debugging strategies. Topics include Data Types, Reference
                        Types, Operators, Objects, Control Statements, and Functions. Projects use these topics in an
                        intensive, hands-on format to build enterprise relevant solutions. GitHub is used to host and
                        share coding projects.

                    <p>Master JavaScript by learning and solving real-world problems. This course continues where the
                        introductory JavaScript course left off. Students use a wide range of JavaScript programming
                        strategies to build interactive programs. Topics include object-oriented programming, unit
                        testing, asynchronous executions, files and streams, lambda expressions, and module bundlers.
                        Problem solving using advanced JavaScript techniques is emphasized. GitHub is used to host and

                        application frameworks and how to build client-rich applications using Angular with TypeScript.
                        Following an intensive, hands-on style format, students will learn how to write code in
                        TypeScript, communicate with middleware platforms using HTTP and WebSocket protocols, automate
                        the building and deployment processes using the Angular CLI, organizing navigation in a Single
                        Page Application (SPAs), learn industry best practices, unit-testing, and deployment. GitHub is

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>This course is an immersive web development bootcamp. It is a full stack experience using the
                        skills previously developed in languages, API, and framework. The course pulls it all together
                        in a more difficult and highly demanding environment. Topics include UI considerations, web
                        services, server-side scripting, and database development and use. Students will complete
                        individual JavaScript projects using the entire web stack. Groups will complete a real-world,
                        highly complex, JavaScript project using the entire web stack and using separate development
                        environments to promote software through development, QA, and production. GitHub is used to
                        store the projects. The course is synchronous with all students participating five nights a week
                        for 9 consecutive weeks.
